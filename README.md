# Java Chess Game

## Overview

This project is a chess game developed in Java as part of a learning exercise to improve programming skills and understanding of the Java language. The goal of this project is to implement a fully functional chess game.

## Features

- **Chessboard Setup**: Initialize the chessboard with all pieces in their starting positions.
- **Piece Movement**: Implement movement rules for each type of chess piece (e.g., King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn).
- **Game Rules**: Enforce chess rules such as check, checkmate, and castling.
- **User Interface**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction with the game.
